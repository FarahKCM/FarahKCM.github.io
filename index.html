						<p>Journalists still occupy a central role in the dissemination of information. Often in the face of personal risk and with little support, they are charged with the mammoth task of finding untold stories, vetting information, crafting compelling narratives and engaging audiences with important information in a noisy, chaotic and often overwhelming era.</p>

						<p>Journalists in developing countries are at a particular disadvantage. Many operate in countries with limited infrastructure, government oppression, few opportunities for training and diminishing profits in already resource-strapped environments. The work of journalism is often difficult, dangerous, thankless and when it fails to produce results, can seem fruitless.</p>

						<p>In these environments, ventures from both local and international players have been launched to tackle the various problems faced by developing world journalists. These range from training programs to independent media outlets to resources for press protection and funding. As journalists recognize the importance of supporting free societies in an increasingly inter-dependent world, efforts to invest in journalism grow.</p>

						<p>Nonetheless, these are severely limited in their reach. Because of geographic or financial limitations, many current efforts only reach a lucky few, and are typically restricted to those who have an established media presence or are attached to an outlet.</p>

						<p>This can be particularly problematic in countries where legacy media is no longer able to provide the public with unbiased journalism. This may not be for a lack of good journalists, but for political or environmental situations. In Mexico, journalists are openly and regularly executed or threatened for revealing sensitive information, both by the government and powerful drug cartels. Cuba is just beginning to allow press freedom, but still balks at free speech. In Iran, government censorship has crippled the ability to conduct journalism openly and safely.</p>
						
						<p> Even in countries that remain free of obvious persecution, the media has not necessarily been able to break into the digital age. Jamaica has one of the best reputations for press freedom in the world, but reporters are still routinely frustrated by a government culture of secrecy which complicates reporting on policy issues. Africa <i>(fyi joe I know Africa is not a single country, but it's a general observation)</i> is enjoying a boom in its mobile usage, but lagging in it's coverage for a lack of a galvanized, active, invested media community. Global media commentators have been struck by the fact that a continent that has so often been spoken for now has plentiful tools to speak for itself, but still largely relies on Western journalism to cover their news. </p>
						
						<p>These, of course, impede our own ability to receive news from abroad, to our detriment. In a world that is increasingly connected geographically, politically and economically, being tapped into other countries has never been more integral, and investing in ways to facilitate it has never been more valuable. <i> (this sounds utopian and pretentious but there's like actual reasons but do I have to enumerate them here?)</i></p>

						<blockquote> "Connecting with people from other backgrounds is hard, even when they live next door or in the same city; paying attention to the problems and concerns of people in the rest of the world is harder still...The Internet will not magically turn us into digital cosmopolitans; if we want to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of connection, we have to take responsibility for shaping the tools we use to encounter the world." -Ethan Zuckerman, "Digital Cosmopolitans" </blockquote>
						
					
						<p>The massive disruption to the industry brought on by the digital age has brought as many opportunities as obstacles. In the news realm, two changes in particular - falling profits and the emergence of citizen journalists - have transformed the nature of foreign affairs coverage.</p>

						<p>As the internet became populated with free content and advertising shifted online, newsrooms had to grapple with plummeting profit margins. Costly foreign bureaus were one of the first expenditures on the chopping block and the quality and quantity of international news fell with them. While some outlets – The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Guardian – have managed to maintain a significant global presence outside their headquarters, by and large, outlets now operate primarily on a local or national level.</p>

						<p>As a result, they’ve had to rely on overseas reports for their news coverage. This, combined with the ease of distribution on the internet, led to the rise of the citizen journalist as an active participant in shaping public dialogue. The increased involvement of citizens in constructing their own narrative has also revealed some of the limitations of outside reporting.	</p>
						
						<p> This has led to unchecked potential for international journalism, which seems to be both booming and faltering. <!---Rewrite that flood metaphor---> While outlets and journalists with limited resources now have more tools than ever, it is also more difficult to grab the attention of an audience who are attached to legacy media, used to highly sophisticated presentation and living in a different world from other cultures. Galvanizing both journalists and audiences to tackle this will take a concerted effort, and no small amount of cooperation. </p>

						<blockquote> We will be better off, in the end, as more and more journalistic media creation of this sort becomes part of the mainstream. This isn't good news for professional spot news photo and video journalists, who are much less likely to be at the scenes of newsworthy events than their "amateur" fellow citizens. But we will have more genuine media than before...and that is a good thing for us all. – Dan Gillmore, Al Jazeera </blockquote>
 
						<p> Though it would be unfair to condemn corporate journalism as unreliable or partisan across the board, there is a growing importance of independent voices in a profit-hungry media world. More established agencies may sacrifice costly or risky international trips for more popular content, and others may be less inclined to publish critical content to appease benefactors with certain interests. Additionally, in the developing world, media outlets may be unable to provide unbiased news coverage not for a lack of integrity, but rather pressure from governments or other powerful groups or a simple lack of proper training. </p>
 
						<p> Where traditional media finds itself floundering, independent organizations and unaffiliated citizen journalists are taking up the gauntlet, though there remains an important distinction between a citizen witness and a citizen journalist. Journalism remains a job, and a difficult one – a citizen journalist as we define it is not the casual blogger or happenstance photographer. A citizen journalist is one who has a vested interest in producing accurate, quality and newsworthy content. </p>

						<p> The citizen journalist has access to parts of a country that foreign correspondents often don’t. Culture, language and knowledge of the area are key in reporting – all of which a citizen has. The previous barriers to the profession, such as equipment and channels of distribution, are now all readily available. </p>
 
						<p> While these outlets and journalists are providing the service of journalism, they are not often given the protection, training or opportunities of established or more resourced journalists. Their work is being picked up by mainstream media with little repayment. </p>

						<p> One of the challenges facing the industry is how to promote equitable relationships between these journalists and organizations in developing countries and those in the developed world, or to journalists with beneficial connections, knowledge or insight. Both have access to valuable commodities. Yet, as it stands now, the exchange between them seems mostly to flow one way. </p>

						<blockquote> ""Just because something seems far away, and just because it happens in a language you don’t understand, doesn’t make it irrelevant...To misunderstand this is to misunderstand the first great lesson of the connected age: we may all have our own burdens, but like it or not, we must bear each other’s burdens as well. - Duncan Watts, Six Degrees </blockquote>
					
						<p> The opening of channels of communication has been of great use to outlets, which can capitalize on having eyes and ears on the ground with minimal investment. Yet this has done little for the journalists and agencies in the countries themselves.</p>

						<p>One of the challenges facing the industry is how to promote equitable relationships between journalists in developing countries and those in the developed world. Both have access to valuable commodities (in developed countries, resources, training, practices, and opportunity for collaboration; in the developed – networks, undiscovered stories, the ability to carry out thorough, long-term reporting from a first-hand perspective.) As it stands now, the exchange seems largely to flow one way. </p>
						
						<p> Citizen journalists remain largely untrained, and many are operating without significant resources. This not only limits the quality of the work they can produce, but also leaves many at risk for persecution. The citizen journalist is at an awkward coming-of-age stage - they have at their disposal a willing audience and innumerable tools with which to reach them, but lack clear direction as to how to best use them, how to find opportunities to practice better journalism, how to market their work, how to connect with established professionals and organizations, or how protect themselves in the process. There is a large pool of potential in the developing world struggling to be realized. </p>
						
						<p> There has been a surge in efforts to improve the state of journalism in underdeveloped countries. There are numerous fellowships, training sessions, individual projects and outreach programs from a variety of organizations, including the Knight Foundation, the UN, the International Center for Journalists, the International Women’s Media Foundation, Internews, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and more. Startups by media entrepreneurs in several countries are seeing success. </p>
						
						<p>However, by their nature, these efforts reach a very limited number of people. Freelance journalists (who are considerable in number) are at a significant disadvantage for their lack of affiliation with an established outlet. </p>
												
						<p> Yet these efforts, while effective, are by nature limited in their outreach. A considerable number of freelance journalists still remain at a significant disadvantage for a shortage of resources and limited access to networks. </p>

						<p> Given our current ability to connect despite geography, and with relatively common technology, it is not infeasible to build bridges between those working in the field and those who would recruit or partner with them.</p>

						<p> One possible solution is to create a formal network specifically aimed at connecting journalists in different countries together. A sort of LinkedIn specific to the industry. When polled, many development journalists said they heavily used online communities in networking, making it a worthwhile medium to work in. </p>

						<p>Formalizing a network has multiple potential benefits from those connected. It could allow sustained contact between journalists who had already met, make it easy to locate journalists working in specific regions or with certain interests, strengthen personal relationships between outlets, groups and individuals and foster a mutually beneficial exchange.</p>

						<p>It may be somewhat easier for established journalists within the field to develop a reliable network, but for unassociated journalists, hyperlocal journalists or just those lacking the opportunities to travel, there are significant challenges. This, however, does not necessarily mean that they would not benefit from the expertise of others.</p> 
						
						<p> The ease of creating a tool for networking is that the heavy lifting is done by the users. Much of the facilitation would be providing a usable, simple but effective meeting point. While now, there are many enthusiastic but disparate entities, used by specific interest groups <i> (again, specific examples needed here?) </i>, it still requires a fair amount of legwork to connect with overseas journalists.</p>
						
						<p> As facebook was first tailored to college students and LinkedIn to professionals, there would be quirks to a network specifically for journalists. First, there would have to be a balance between highlighting a journalist's work and highlighting the journalist themselves. Platforms like Global Voices and GroundReport have served well in providing mainstream news with support for foreign affairs stories, but done little for the writers themselves.</p>
						
						<p> Additionally, given the nature of the citizen journalist, a credible network would need to involve a vetting process. MuckRack individually sorts through applicants by hand, requiring a certain number of reports filed in a certain amount of time. An entirely different, but wildly popular network, CouchSurfing, relied heavily on public recommendations or warnings from users on other users, creating an internal-monitoring system.</p>
						
						<p> Finally, purely in usability, the network would have to be modern enough to be compatible with the advanced digital storytelling tools we have, but simple enough that citizen journalists who may be somewhat unfamiliar with the landscape do not have too steep a learning curve when attempting to use it. </p>
