						<p>Journalists still occupy a central role in the dissemination of information. Charged with the mammoth task of finding untold stories, vetting information, crafting compelling narratives and publicizing important stories in a noisy, chaotic and often overwhelming era.</p>

						<p>Journalists in developing countries are at a particular disadvantage. With many operating in countries with limited infrastructure, government oppression, few opportunities for training and diminishing profits in already resource-strapped environments, the work of journalism is often difficult, risky, thankless and can seem fruitless.</p>

						<p>Initiatives on the ground as well as from international agencies have popped up to tackle the various problems faced by developing world journalists. Training programs, independent media outlets, resources for protection and funding – as journalists recognize the importance of supporting free and just societies in an increasingly inter-dependent world, efforts to invest in journalism grow.</p>

						<p>Nonetheless, these are severely limited in their reach. Because of geographic or financial limitations, many current efforts only reach a lucky few journalists, and normally only those who have an established media presence or are attached to an outlet.</p>

						<p>This can be particularly problematic in countries where legacy media is no longer, or limited in its ability to, provide the public with unbiased journalism. This may not be for a lack of good journalists, but for political situations. In Mexico, journalists are openly and regularly executed or threatened for revealing sensitive information, both by the government and powerful drug cartels. Cuba is just beginning to allow press freedom, but still balks at free speech. In Iran, government censorship has crippled the ability to conduct journalism openly and safely.</p>
						
						<p>In a world that is increasingly connected, geographically, politically and economically, being tapped into other countries has never been more integral, and investing in ways to facilitate it has never been more valuable. </p>

                    <h1>News in the Digital Age</h1>
					
						<blockquote> "Connecting with people from other backgrounds is hard, even when they live next door or in the same city; paying attention to the problems and concerns of people in the rest of the world is harder still...The Internet will not magically turn us into digital cosmopolitans; if we want to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of connection, we have to take responsibility for shaping the tools we use to encounter the world." -Ethan Zuckerman, "Digital Cosmopolitans" </blockquote>
						
					
						<p>The massive disruption to the industry brought on by the digital age has brought as many opportunities as obstacles. For foreign news, two changes in particular - falling profits and the emergence of citizen journalists - have transformed the nature of foreign affairs coverage.</p>

						<p>As the internet became populated with free content and advertising shifted, newsrooms had to grapple with plummeting profit margins. Costly foreign bureaus were one of the first expenditures on the chopping block and the quality and quantity of international news fell with it. While some outlets – The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Guardian – have managed to maintain a significant global presence outside their headquarters, by and large, outlets now operate primarily on a local or national level.</p>

						<p>As a result, they’ve had to rely on overseas reports for their news coverage. This, combined with the ease of distribution on the internet, led to the rise of the citizen journalist as an active participant in shaping public dialogue. The increased involvement of citizens in constructing their own narrative has also revealed some of the limitations of outside reporting.	</p>
						
						<p> This has led to unchecked potential for international journalism, which seems to be both booming and faltering. <!---Rewrite that flood metaphor---> While outlets and journalists with limited resources now have more tools than ever, it is also more difficult to grab the attention of an audience who are attached to legacy media, used to highly sophisticated presentation and living in a different world from other cultures. Galvanizing both journalists and audiences to tackle this will take a concerted effort, and no small amount of cooperation. </p>

                    <h1>Citizen Journalism</h1>
					
						<blockquote> We will be better off, in the end, as more and more journalistic media creation of this sort becomes part of the mainstream. This isn't good news for professional spot news photo and video journalists, who are much less likely to be at the scenes of newsworthy events than their "amateur" fellow citizens. But we will have more genuine media than before, as in the authenticity of the London image, and that is a good thing for us all. – Dan Gillmore, Al Jazeera </blockquote>
 
						<p> Though it would be unfair to condemn corporate journalism as unreliable or partisan across the board, there is a growing importance of independent voices in a profit-hungry media world. More established agencies may sacrifice costly or risky international trips for more popular content, and others may be less inclined to publish critical content to appease benefactors with certain interests. Additionally, in the developing world, media outlets may be unable to provide unbiased news coverage not for a lack of integrity, but rather pressure from governments or other powerful groups or a simple lack of proper training. </p>
 
						<p> Where traditional media is floundering, independent organizations or unaffiliated citizen journalists are taking up the gauntlet. , though there remains an important distinction between a citizen witness and a citizen journalist. Journalism remains a job, and a difficult one – a citizen journalist as we define it is not the casual blogger or happenstance photographer. A citizen journalist is one who has a vested interest in producing accurate, quality and newsworthy content. </p>

						<p> The citizen journalist has access to parts of a country that foreign correspondents often don’t. Culture, language and knowledge of the area are key in reporting – all of which a citizen has. The previous barriers to the profession, equipment, training, distribution, are now all readily available.) </p>
 
						<p> While these outlets and journalists are providing the service of journalism, they are not often given the protection, training or opportunities of established or more resourced journalists. Their work is being picked up by mainstream media with little repayment. </p>

						<p> One of the challenges facing the industry is how to promote equitable relationships between these journalists and organizations in developing countries and those in the developed world, or to journalists with beneficial connections, knowledge or insight. Both have access to valuable commodities. Yet, as it stands now, the exchange between them seems mostly to flow one way. </p>

						<h2> DISLIKE BAD WRITING FIX IT </h2>
					
						<blockquote> ""Just because something seems far away, and just because it happens in a language you don’t understand, doesn’t make it irrelevant...To misunderstand this is to misunderstand the first great lesson of the connected age: we may all have our own burdens, but like it or not, we must bear each other’s burdens as well. - Duncan Watts, Six Degrees </blockquote>
					
						<p> The opening of channels of communication has been of great use to outlets, which can capitalize on having eyes and ears on the ground with minimal investment. Yet this has done little for the journalists and agencies in the countries themselves.</p>

						<p>One of the challenges facing the industry is how to promote equal relationships between journalists in developing countries and those in the developed world. Both have access to valuable commodities (in developed countries, resources, training, practices, and opportunity for collaboration; in the developed – networks, undiscovered stories, the ability to carry out thorough, long-term reporting from a first-hand perspective.) As it stands now, the exchange seems largely to flow one way. </p>
						
						<p> Citizen journalists remain largely untrained, and many are operating without significant resources. This not only limits the quality of the work they can produce, but also leaves many at risk for persecution. The citizen journalist is at an awkward coming-of-age stage - they have at their disposal a willing audience and innumerable tools with which to reach them, but lack clear direction as to how to best use them, how to find opportunities to practice better journalism, how to market their work, how to connect with established professionals and organizations, or how protect themselves in the process. There is a large pool of potential in the developing world struggling to be realized. </p>
						
						<p> There has been a surge in efforts to improve the state of journalism in underdeveloped countries. There are numerous fellowships, training sessions, individual projects and outreach programs from a variety of organizations, including the Knight Foundation, the UN, the International Center for Journalists, the International Women’s Media Foundation, Internews, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and more. Startups by media entrepreneurs in several countries are seeing success. </p>
						
						<p>However, by their nature, these efforts reach a very limited number of people. Freelance journalists (who are considerable in number) are at a significant disadvantage for their lack of affiliation with an established outlet. </p>
												
						<p> Yet these efforts, while effective, are by nature limited in their outreach. A considerable number of freelance journalists still remain at a significant disadvantage for a shortage of resources and limited access to networks. </p>

						<p> Given our current ability to connect despite geography, and with relatively common technology, it is not infeasible to build bridges between those working in the field and those who would recruit or partner with them.</p>

						<p> One possible solution is to create a formal network specifically aimed at connecting journalists in different countries together. A sort of LinkedIn specific to the industry. When polled, many development journalists said they heavily used online communities in networking, making it a worthwhile medium to work in. </p>

						<p>Formalizing a network has multiple potential benefits from those connected. It could allow sustained contact between journalists who had already met, make it easy to locate journalists working in specific regions or with certain interests, strengthen personal relationships between outlets, groups and individuals and foster a mutually beneficial exchange.</p>

						<p>It may be somewhat easier for established journalists within the field to develop a reliable network, but for unassociated journalists, hyperlocal journalists or just those lacking the opportunities to travel, there are significant challenges. This, however, does not necessarily mean that they would not benefit from the expertise of others.</p>

					<h3> Mexico </h3>


					<b> Press Freedom Index Ranking: 148/180 </b>
 
					<p> Mexico’s track record on journalist freedom leaves much to be desired. Highlighted by slews of attacks on the press, by both the government and powerful crime organizations, practicing journalism in the country is becoming increasingly dangerous.  Jorge Luis Sierra, a Knight Fellow working specifically on improving security for journalists on the ground (and creator of Periodistas in Riesgo and Mi Panama Transparente) </p>

					<p> Mexico’s journalists are online, and could benefit significantly from a greater access to media outlets to publish work, and better training or resources on how to encrypt data, conduct safe investigative journalism and solidify alliances with others interested in stories on the ground. </p>
 
 
					<h3> Brazil </h3>


					<b>Press Freedom Index Ranking: 99/180 </b>
 
					<p> Despite Brazil’s increasing prominence worldwide, it is a deadly place for journalists, faring only marginally better than Pakistan and Russia. Although Brazil is booming online – the country has an impressive 53% internet penetration – it is failing at maximizing the potential to use the medium to promote unbiased and uncensored journalism. Blocking and article takedowns are common in Brazil, and an incestuous relationship between government, advertising and media mean that journalists are often working within a certain agenda and under constant fear of litigation. </p>

					<p> A report by Reporters Without Borders outlined several cases of political intervention in media activity, including the arrest of Google Brazil president Fabio Coelho for lagging in removing a video that insulted a candidate. </p>
					
					<p> 


					<h3> Syria </h3>
 
 
					<b> Press Freedom Index Ranking: 177/180 </b>
 
					<p> Given recent events, there may be few places that intimidate a journalist more than Syria. A protracted and bloody civil war combined with the barbaric executions of reporters James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Kenji Goto have made international headlines and drawn attention to the plight of freelance reporters worldwide. </p>

					<p> An increase in the participation of citizen journalists who have access to dangerous or inaccessible areas has made informal journalism integral in covering the Syrian conflict. Index on Censorship magazine collaborated with Syria Tracker – a platform monitoring press activity in Syria – and found that apart from the city of Homs, the majority of the reports were coming from citizen journalists (with the caveat that only 6% of data is considered well sourced enough for publication, though the low percentage might be attributed to the chaotic nature of war rather than sheer unreliability.) </p>
					
					<!---MENTION WOMEN UNDER SIEGE MAP--->
					
					<p> The actual spread of technology in the country is somewhat limited, but the necessity and quality of the reporting highlights the need and the worth of new forms of journalism, and forming connections with journalists, even in the most unlikely of places. </p>  


 
					<h3> Egypt </h3>
 
 
					<b> Press Freedom Index Ranking: 158/180 </b>

					<p> Egypt stands as an example of the potential of harnessing the power of online networks. The Egyptian revolution exploded online, with many using digital media to unite citizen journalists with mainstream media outlets. </p>

					<p> Nonetheless, Egypt remains one of the world’s top jailers of journalists. The case of three Al-Jazeera journalists imprisoned under dubious charges caught the world’s attention, eliciting comment even from Barack Obama. </p>
					
					<p> With around 48% of the population online, and a politically active population, Egypt's potential for impactful digital journalism is great, but it is impeded by government interference. While the law struggles to keep pace with the new forms of media, journalists often fall victim to unclear laws regarding libel, defamation and free speech. A sometimes violent environment can make it difficult for journalists to operate. A fragile and semi-legitimate government who keep close tabs on the media can make free speech intimidating, even if it's not strictly illegal.</p>
					
					<p> Steady connections outside of the country, whether informally or formally, offer obvious solutions to some of the problems, and even access to basic guidelines for working during conflict, the ability to keep in touch with other professionals who would notice disappearances or intimidation and hold others accountable or the mere sense of camaraderie from others working in similar situations could give independent journalists a much needed boost. </p>
