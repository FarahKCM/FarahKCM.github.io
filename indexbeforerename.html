						<p>Journalists still occupy a central role in the dissemination of information. Charged with the mammoth task of finding untold stories, vetting information, crafting compelling narratives and  important stories in a noisy, chaotic and often overwhelming era.</p>

						<p>Journalists in developing countries are at a particular disadvantage. With many operating in countries with limited infrastructure, government oppression, few opportunities for training and diminishing profits in already resource-limited environments, the work of journalism is often difficult, risky, thankless and can seem fruitless.</p>

						<p>Initiatives on the ground as well as from international agencies have popped up to tackle the various problems faced by developing world journalists. Training programs, independent media outlets, resources for protection and funding – as journalists recognize the importance of supporting free and just societies in increasingly inter-dependent societies, efforts to invest in journalism grow.</p>

						<p>Nonetheless, these are severely limited in their reach. Because of geographic or financial limitations, many current efforts only reach a lucky few journalists, and normally only those who have an established media presence or are attached to an outlet.</p>

						<p>This can be particularly problematic in countries where legacy media is no longer, or limited in its ability to provide the public with unbiased journalism. This may not be for a lack of good journalists, but for political situations. In Mexico, journalists are openly and regularly executed or threatened for revealing sensitive information, both by the government and powerful drug cartels. Cuba is just beginning to allow press freedom. In Iran, government censorship has crippled the ability to conduct journalism openly and safely.</p>

                    <h1>News in the Digital Age</h1>
					
						<p>The massive disruption to the industry brought on by the digital age has brought as many opportunities as obstacles. For foreign news, two changes in particular - falling profits and the emergence of citizen journalists - have transformed the nature of foreign affairs coverage.</p>

						<p>As the internet became populated with free content and advertising shifted, newsrooms had to grapple with plummeting profit margins. Costly foreign bureaus were one of the first expenditures on the chopping block and the quality and quantity of international news fell with it. While some outlets – The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Guardian – have managed to maintain a significant global presence outside their headquarters, by and large, outlets now operate primarily on a local or national level.</p>

						<p>As a result, they’ve had to rely on overseas reports for their news coverage. This, combined with the ease of distribution on the internet, led to the rise of the citizen journalist as an active participant in shaping public dialogue. The increased involvement of citizens in constructing their own narrative has also revealed some of the limitations of outside reporting.	</p>

                    <h1>Citizen Journalism</h1>
					
						<p>Citizen journalists are responsible for some iconic imagery and vital resources in news –dispatches from Iran and Egypt on twitter, a clip of an airplane hitting a moving van shot on a mobile phone, voice recordings from aboard planes - some of the most compelling pieces of media today are produced by those who just happen to be in the wrong place at the right time. </p>
						
						<p> We are here assuming that there is a distinction between a citizen journalist and a bystander with a camera phone. A citizen journalist can be one who is actively engaged in the practice of journalism with the thoroughness and dedication one would expect of a professional, but unaffiliated with an outlet and without formal training.</p> 
						
						<p>Scattered and unorganized though thsi group may be, independent voices are growing in importance in a profit-hungry media world, and in many instances in the developing world, where government-owned outlets, or outlets under government pressure, may be unable to provide unbiased news coverage. <em>EXAMPLES EXAMPLES.</em> </p>
						
						<p> Yet citizen journalists remain largely untrained, and many are operating without significant resources. This not only limits the quality of the work they can produce, but also leaves many at risk for persecution. The citizen journalist is at an awkward coming-of-age stage - they have at their disposal a willing audience and innumerable tools with which to reach them, but lack clear direction as to how to best use them, how to find opportunities to practice better journalism, how to market their work, how to connect with established professionals and organizations, or how protect themselves in the process. There is a large pool of potential in the developing world struggling to be realized. </p>

                    <h1>Network</h1>
					
						<p> The opening of channels of communication has been of great use to outlets, which can capitalize on having eyes and ears on the ground with minimal investment. Yet this has done little for the journalists and agencies in the countries themselves.</p>

						<p>One of the challenges facing the industry is how to promote equal relationships between journalists in developing countries and those in the developed world. Both have access to valuable commodities (in developed countries, resources, training, practices, and opportunity for collaboration; in the developed – networks, undiscovered stories, the ability to carry out thorough, long-term reporting from a first-hand perspective.) As it stands now, the exchange seems largely to flow one way. </p>
						
						<p> There has been a surge in efforts to improve the state of journalism in underdeveloped countries. There are numerous fellowships, training sessions, individual projects and outreach programs from a variety of organizations, including the Knight Foundation, the UN, the International Center for Journalists, the International Women’s Media Foundation, Internews, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and more. Startups by media entrepreneurs in several countries are seeing success. </p>
						
						<p>However, by their nature, these efforts reach a very limited number of people. Freelance journalists (who are considerable in number) are at a significant disadvantage for their lack of affiliation with an established outlet. </p>>
						
						<p> Yet citizen journalists remain largely untrained, and many are operating without significant resources. This not only limits the quality of the work they can produce, but also leaves many at risk for persecution.

                    <h1>The Project</h1>
					
						<p> Given our current ability to connect despite geography, and with relatively common technology, it is not infeasible to build bridges between those working in the field and those who would recruit or partner with them.</p>

						<p> One possible solution is to create a formal network specifically aimed at connecting journalists in different countries together. A sort of LinkedIn specific to the industry. When polled, many development journalists said they heavily used online communities in networking, making it a worthwhile medium to work in. </p>

						<p>Formalizing a network has multiple potential benefits from those connected. It could allow sustained contact between journalists who had already met, make it easy to locate journalists working in specific regions or with certain interests, strengthen personal relationships between outlets, groups and individuals and foster a mutually beneficial exchange.</p>

						<p>It may be somewhat easier for established journalists within the field to develop a reliable network, but for unassociated journalists, hyperlocal journalists or just those lacking the opportunities to travel, there are significant challenges. This, however, does not necessarily mean that they would not benefit from the expertise of others.</p>
